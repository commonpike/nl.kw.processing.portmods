Built for Processing 3, PortMods are pieces of Java code with input
and output ports that can be chained. For a detailed description, see
<https://commonpike.github.io/nl.kw.processing.portmods/docs/PortMods.pdf>

## Installation

You may be able to install this through the Processing IDE.
It should end up your "sketchbook location",
also sometimes called the "processing library directory".
You can find its location in the Processing app, in the menu,
under preferences. It's usually in your homedir somewhere.

Or you can download it from GIT, and put it in that folder
yourself: 
<https://github.com/commonpike/nl.kw.processing.portmods>

Make sure to rename the local folder to 'PortMods'.
Once it's there, choose 'sketch > import library'
from the menu bar.
